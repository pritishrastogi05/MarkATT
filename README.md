<h1>MarkATT</h1><br>

<h2>What is it about?</h2>
<p>
	MarkATT stands for Marking Attendance. Yet, its way more than merely marking attendance!<br>
	With the advent of the covid-pandemic and the meteoric rise in online mode of work; we saww that monitoring was a tough task. While there were several 		video-conference platforms; not all provided elaborate monitoring.<br>
	That is, ERP - integrated reporting automation. Online meetings with videos off, a low attention span yet all being marked present was a great problem for 	admnistartors, so was managing records.<br>
	That's where the idea of MarkATT came in - an automated onboarding, monitoring and reposrting application all in one!<br>
	Featuring its automated MLOps pipeline for data collection, augmentation, encryption and model training - it is just a single touch point for admnistrators 
 	to manage their online operations.
